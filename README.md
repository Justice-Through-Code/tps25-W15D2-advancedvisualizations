Key Terms

    Interactive Visualization: Charts that respond to user input like clicks, hovers, and selections
    Annotation: Text, arrows, or shapes added to highlight specific data points or regions
    Overlay: Additional visual elements layered on top of the main plot
    Tooltip: Information box that appears when hovering over data points
    Blitting: Technique for efficient redrawing of plot elements
    Event Handling: Capturing and responding to user interactions with plots
    Data Cursor: Interactive element for exploring exact data values
    Style Sheet: Predefined visual settings for consistent plot appearance
    Axes Coordination: Synchronizing multiple plots to zoom/pan together
    Canvas Redraw: Process of updating the plot display after changes
